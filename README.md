****Insurance Management System - README**

**Overview**

This project implements a simple Insurance Management System using object-oriented programming in Python.
It is designed to demonstrate class design, object interactions, and basic management operations for:

* Policyholders

* Insurance Products

* Payments

The system includes methods for managing policyholder status, payment processing, and product administration.
Finally, two sample policyholders are created who have successfully paid for at least one product, with their information displayed.

Features
✅ 1. Policyholder Class

Represents an individual insurance policyholder.
Implements the following functionality:

Register Policyholder

Suspend Policyholder

Reactivate Policyholder

View Policyholder Account Details

✅ 2. Product Class

Represents an insurance product.
Includes methods for:

Creating a product

Updating product information

Removing or suspending a product

✅ 3. Payment Class

Handles all payment-related operations, including:

Processing payments

Sending payment reminders

Applying penalties for late payments

**System Demonstration**
The project demonstrates the interaction between classes by:

Creating at least two policyholders

Assigning them insurance products

Recording successful payments

Displaying their account details, including product and payment status

Example Output

The final output includes a display of policyholder details similar to:
======================================
 Policy Holder Details
--------------------------------------
 Name: Thomas Mason
 Policy ID: 102
 Product: Deluxe Home Shield
 Status: Active
 Payment Status: Paid
======================================
